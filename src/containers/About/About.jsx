                        Hi my name is Gavin Stirling and I am a Junior Software
                        Developer training with _Nology in London.
                        <br />
                        <br />I am originally from South Africa and have a
                        degree in Mechanical Engineering. I relocated to the UK
                        with my Wife, Tania, in April of 2022. This was also
                        when I decided to make the change in career towards
                        Software Development.
